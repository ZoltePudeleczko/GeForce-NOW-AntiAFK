# Nvidia GeForceNOW AntiAFK

Tiny little autohotkey script which should stop GeForce NOW's afk system.

## How it works?
As long as the program detects that GeForce NOW is running it sends a 'F13' key input every 4 minutes. According to my tests it is enough to stop the AFK detection system.

You can safely let this program run in the background and it will only become active when you start GeForceNOW session.
